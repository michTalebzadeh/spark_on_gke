# spark_on_gke
This repositoy includes what is necessary in Kubernetes AKA k8s for the deployment of Spark, which is an open-source distributed computing framework. One can utilize code developed in Python, Scala, SQL and others to create applications that can process large amount of data. Spark uses parallel processing to distribute the work-load across a cluster of physical hosts, for example, nodes of Kubernetes cluster.
I will explain the practical implementation of Spark on Kubernetes (Spark-on-k8s) and will leverage Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) (Google was first to introduce and then open source Kubernetes) and show steps in implementing Spark on GKE cluster-manager by creating a simple yet effective example that uses PySpark to generate random test data in Spark, take that data and post it to Google BigQuery Data Warehouse table.
